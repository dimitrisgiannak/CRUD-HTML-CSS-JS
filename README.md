# CRUD-HTML-CSS-JS

                 

We needed to provide forms for Courses , Trainers , Students , Assignments and each one
had their very own specific fields. Also we needed to implement the functionality CRUD.
Having no database means that each time we reload a page or redirect to another the inputs
will be lost.

To make it a bit more realistic we act like we have created a superuser account and we log 
in. 

# How to run
